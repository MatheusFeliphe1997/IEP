Short-Term Objective: Student will be able to identify different strategies he can use for different concerns (e.g. If I'm feeling tired, I can ask to stand while taking notes; If I'm feeling frustrated, I can neutrally ask for space while I calm down).  

Progress Report 1: 6/8/2020  
Summary of Progress: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sufficient data on these goals could not be collected. Goal will be continued onto new IEP and then updated when met.

Progress Report 3: 1/10/2021  
Summary of Progress: According to teacher observation and parent/student input, student is continuing to withdraw from work and feel defeated instead of employing coping strategies.

### SECTION OFFER OF FAPE - SERVICE
Student Name: Last Name, Student  
Birthdate: 3/6/2005  
IEP Date: 4/22/2021  
The service options that were considered by the IEP team (List all): During the period of school closure related to COVID-19, the IEP team considered virtual learning without supplementary aids & services, virtual learning with supplementary aids & services, and continued in-person supplementary aids & services during the period of school closure. When the temporary period of school closure ends, student will return to previous placement: General education, special education with push in pull out services, behavior intervention services. In selecting LRE, describe the consideration given to any potential harmful effect on the child or on the quality of services that he or she needs: The IEP team considered the harmful effects of the proposed placement, virtual learning with supplementary aids & services, including limited access to general education content, limited access to special education services, and possible regression and lack of recoupment associated with a prolonged period of distance learning. The IEP team also discussed the harmful effects of in-person service provision, including the possible legal ramifications of violating the Bay Area’s Shelter In Place Order, in addition to the risk to public health and health of Student. The IEP team believes that the possible harmful effects of the placement of virtual learning with supplemental aids & services are outweighed by the necessity to protect public health and the health of Student. The IEP team will consider the appropriateness and/or necessity of compensatory services and/or extended school year upon return to typical school operations.

Team Members present: Erica Tietz (Case Manager), Student Last Name (Student), Marilu Alvarez (Parent), Jose Arinez (Interpreter), Kim Vo (Assistant Principal), Jacob Sekins (Teacher)

Case Manager reviewed purpose of meeting, the agenda, and introductions were made. Procedural Safeguards were explained and a written copy was sent to parent via email. A written copy of the Medi-Cal notice was also sent to parent via email.

Teachers shared that while Student is a kind, respectful, and enjoyable student to have in class, Student often shows little to no engagement with the material or work completion in general. Student reported a lack of motivation, a preference for working in-person as opposed to online, and stated that he doesn't feel like teachers should be spending their time working with him when there are other students to worry about.

Parent provided input about her concern for his progress and gratitude for the school and teachers. Teachers affirmed how much everyone cares about Student and his success. Case Manager confirmed Student will begin meeting with the Mental Health Counselor again to ensure he has support in this area.

The Case Manager discussed Anthony's transition plan and progress towards graduation. Case Manager reviewed current credits earned in pursuit of a KSIC high school diploma, which Student is on track to earn in 2023. Case Manager discussed various schedule options available if Student continues to pass all classes. Case Manager shared that she’ll email the graduation plan with the other IEP documents.

Teacher reviewed Cyber High (independent credit recovery) and summer school options, should Student happen to fail more classes this semester. Student clarified various scenarios in which he passed some classes, but not all, and the team discussed the different pathways that would occur.

Case Manager suggested a positive reinforcement system in which Student can earn food delivery to his house for each passing grade, which Student and parent agreed to. The IEP team had no questions at this time. The case manager proposed new IEP. Present levels of performance and progress on old goals were reviewed. New proposed goals were reviewed and agreed upon by the IEP Team. Goals will also reflect transition goals.

Statewide Assessments and special factors were reviewed. Offer of FAPE was reviewed, including accommodations and services. A written copy of the IEP was provided to the parent via email. Parent consent will be sent via Docusign. Meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.
