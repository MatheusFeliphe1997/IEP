The service options that were considered by the IEP team (List all): The IEP team considered general education, general education with supplemental aids and services, and general education with supplemental aids and services and specialized academic instruction. The IEP team believes that the appropriate placement is general education with supplemental aids and services and specialized academic instruction. 

In selecting LRE, describe the consideration given to any potential harmful effect on the child or on the quality of services that he or she needs: The IEP team considered the possible harmful effects of the placement, including limited access to general education content, as well as limited access to typically developing peers during service time, and any negative impact to Antonio's self-esteem. The IEP team does not believe that there are any significant harmful effects at this time and that Antonio's needs significantly outweigh any minimal harmful effects.

### SECTION IEP TEAM MEETING NOTES
Student Name: Last Name, Birthdate: 6/21/2003  
IEP Date: 3/24/2021  
Date: 3/26/2019  

Notes: Purpose explained by Education Specialist: Triennial IEP, Annual IEP, Transitional Planning Introductions were made. Participants present at meeting include: Eliana Porton (Education Specialist/Math Foundations Teacher), Christine Dela Rosa (Freshman Seminar teacher), Tom Ryan (Principal), Ana Cruz (Spanish Interpreter), Katie Pettersen (School Psychologist), Monica Sanchez (English 9 Teacher), Jack Monagle (Pre AP History Teacher), Blanca Bracamontes (Parent) o Bracamontes (Student).  

Parent Rights were presented in Spanish and an explanation was offered.  

Positives: Student- passing most of my classes. Turning things in! Parent: What happens at home is connected to what happens at school. I always ask if he’s doing his homework. I am always on him about getting work done. I notice that the teachers dedicate a lot of time to his progress. He is conscious about how much effort he needs to put in and it’s his future and it depends on his effort that he puts into it. He knows to put in his best effort because he is fortunate to be here.  

Principal: Very personable, positive vibe. Freshman Seminar teacher: Happiest student, always smiling. I see improvements from the beginning of the year. Turns in a lot more work. Improved in making better choices in terms of who he works with in groups (more productive). Math Foundations/Ed Specialist: Optimistic, positive. Mindset is determined and growth-oriented. Will try and try again if something is difficult, will ask for help. A lot of improvement in his perseverance and willingness to challenge himself.  

School Psychologist: Favorite student to work with! Parent: He has loss of focus and attention and I know that also affects students with depression and I talk to him that he needs to work hard for the things he wants and he needs to be confident to talk to people if he has a problem. English 9 Teacher: Fearlessness - courageous. Participated in Black History Month celebration where he presented his poem to the community that came out for that event. Will email mom the pictures of the event!  

School Psych shared results of psycho-educational assessment report. This is his 4th re-evaluation. School Psychologist did a file review of previous evaluations. A copy of the report was shared with parent and team members. She shared a resource, Understood.Org. Has qualified in past for SLD and OHI (for ADHD diagnosis), he was previously on medication in elementary school.  

Bell curve and standards cores explained to parent using a visual aid. Reviewed cognitive assessment results. Strengths include Crystalized Knowledge (scoring within average range), which is a measure of how much information and knowledge he’s been able to pick up through his life experiences. Long-Term Memory is also a strength and relatively strong visual processing skills. Areas that are most impacting him academically include Short-Term Memory which means when he is given a lot of information to use immediately, he may need reminders or repeated information in order to use it accurately. Working Memory is also a relative weakness, linked to ADHD and executive functioning skills (like organizing, time-management, planning). The IEP team should focus on supporting his executive functioning skills (turning work in on time, completing work accurately, etc.).  

3 years ago in 6th grade, the academic skills were very similar, so this is a historically challenging area. School Psychologist shared academic assessment results. Student does meet the eligibility criteria within the area of Specific Learning Disability. Parent was asked if she had any questions, she did not have any at this time. The other area of disability considered was Other Health Impairment and he continues to meet the requirements in this area as well. Impulsivity and difficulties with attention continue to show up as issues in classes and by parent reports at home.  

Anxiety and Depression did not come up as a significant issue based on reports, however, anxiety is something that Student struggles with and will have negative thoughts and negative self-talk. School Psychologist shared with parent that Student has access to our mental health counselor, Ms. Anaya, at any time to talk about stress or negative thoughts/feelings and get help with strategies to combat that. Parent asked why he hasn’t gone to see MHC. Student shared that he forgets to see her. He said that those feelings come and go. School Psychologist will connect with MHC and ask her to check in with Student. History teacher shared that they had a conversation about how to deal with mental health when it’s manageable (like anxiety) and not to wait until it’s so bad that it’s “broken”.
``` ```
### SECTION IEP TEAM MEETING NOTES
Gen. Ed Teachers share that they also hear negative self-talk. English teacher shared that Student avoids work when it starts to get overwhelming. Parent asked Student what he thinks he needs to be successful. He shared he wants to be able to play basketball and will need a 2.0 GPA, so will need to turn in homework on time. IEP team agrees that he qualifies for special education services under SLD and OHI. Education Specialist reviewed the IEP, starting with the Individualized Transition Plan. Student reported that he would like to go to the Navy SEALs, and then go to college after, and eventually become a firefighter. Ed Specialist stated that the ITP is to help him build the skills necessary to achieve his goals related to education, career, and independent living. Education Specialist also explained the graduation expectations, noting that there is another option that the team may want to explore down the road, which would be an alternative diploma track that would support Antonio’s ability to graduate with a California diploma rather than a “School” diploma. Education Specialist reviewed previous IEP goals. Student met his reading fluency, writing, and math goal. Education specialist reviewed proposed goals. School Psychologist recommended incorporating an executive functioning goal related to work completion. Team discussed and agreed to all goals, including adding an executive functioning goal around work completion. Ed Specialist reviewed the proposed accommodations. Of note, team discussed the importance of shortening assignments. Freshman Seminar Teacher asked about grading when assignments are being shortened. Team clarified that assignments can still be graded out of the full number of problems so that grading is not impacted. Another teacher also noted that Student benefits from sitting near strong peer models. The team discussed and agreed to all accommodations as written in the IEP. Fd Specialist reviewed proposed services. School San Collegiate’s offer of FAPE is Specialist Academic Instruction (275 minutes weekly), College Awareness (30 minutes monthly), and Career Awareness (30 minutes monthly). Team agreed to KIPP’s offer of FAPE. Parent asked if teachers who were not present would be given this information. Ed Specialist stated that it is her job as case manager to share all information with all of Antonio’s teachers. She stated that if Student or parent ever has any concerns about the IEP, they are encouraged to talk to her. Parent agreed to all parts of the IEP, and signed consent to the IEP. Parent was informed of Medi-Cal relationship and their rights in giving consent and signed consent. Parent requested documents be translated to Spanish.

### SECTION ALTERNATE ASSESSMENT DECISION CONFIRMATION WORKSHEET
Student Name: Last Name, Birthdate: 6/21/2003 IEP Date: 3/24/2021 Participation in Alternate Assessments Does the student have a significant cognitive disability and an IEP? [ ] L] Yes [ ] L] No If yes, continue with this confirmation worksheet. If no, the student is not eligible to take alternate assessments. If yes, the IEP team confirms that a review of the student's records and IEP indicates a disability or multiple disabilities that significantly impact intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. Adaptive behavior is defined as behavior that is essential for a person to live independently and to function safely in daily life. Sources of evidence may include, but are not limited to, results of the following: e Individual cognitive ability test e Adaptive behavior skills assessment ¢ Informal assessments ¢ Individual reading assessments e Districtwide alternate assessments ¢ Achievement tests e Language assessments, including English learner (EL) language assessments, if applicable If yes, the student is eligible for the following assessments: ¢ CAA for English language arts/literacy ¢ CAA for Mathematics * CAA for Science e Initial Alt-ELPAC, if the student's Home Language Survey indicates a primary language other than English ¢ Summative Alt-ELPAC, if the student is identified as an EL Alignment with Standards Students eligible for an alternate assessment should be learning content aligned with the California Common Core State Standards (CA CCSS), the California Next Generation Science Standards (CA NGSS), or, as applicable, the 2012 California English Language Development Standards (2012 CA ELD Standards). Goals and instruction listed in the IEP for this student are aligned with the enrolled grade-level CA CCSS, CA NGSS, and 2012 CA ELD Standards. Sources of evidence may include, but are not limited to, the following: e Progress monitoring data e Present levels of academic and functional performance, goals, and objectives from the IEP ¢ Data from scientific research-based interventions e Examples of curriculum, instructional objectives, and materials [ ] CO The IEP team confirms that the student is or will be learning content aligned with the standards listed above. Instruction and Supports Students eligible for an alternate assessment require extensive, direct individualized instruction and substantial supports to achieve measurable gains in the grade- and age-appropriate curriculum. The student (a) requires extensive repeated, individualized instruction and support that is not of a temporary nature; and (b) uses substantially adapted materials and individualized methods of accessing information in alternative ways to acquire, maintain, generalize, demonstrate, and transfer skills across academic content. Sources of evidence may include, but are not limited to, the following: e Examples of curriculum, instructional objectives, and materials, including work samples from both school- and community-based instruction ¢ Teacher-collected data and checklists e Present levels of academic and functional performance, goals, objectives, and post-school outcomes from the IEP and the transition plan for students aged sixteen and older
``` ```
### SECTION ALTERNATE ASSESSMENT DECISION CONFIRMATION WORKSHEET
The IEP team confirms that the student is or will be receiving extensive direct individualized instruction and substantial supports to achieve measurable gain. IEP Team Statement of Assurance: Our decision was based on multiple pieces of evidence that, when taken together, demonstrated that the Alternate Assessment is the most appropriate assessment for this student. The student has been determined to be the most significantly cognitively impaired; the student has been shown to require extensive, direct individualized instruction and substantial supports to achieve measurable gains on the challenging state alternate academic achievement/performance content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled; the student was not identified solely on the basis of the student’s previous low academic achievement or the student’s previous need for accommodations to participate in general state or districtwide assessments; and that any additional implications of this decision were discussed thoroughly.
``` ```

Teacher data and student work indicate that Student has performed admirably in his classes this year, with strong engagement and self-advocacy. He has shown a lot of improvement in his work completion, but at times struggles to keep track of deadlines and organize assignments in a manageable way. He also would benefit from support with recalling equations and procedures from his mathematics instruction. Further input will be shared at the IEP meeting. 

Communication Development (Student) is able to communicate with teachers and peers his questions, thoughts, and concerns. Sometimes, Student struggles with finding the words he wants to use when speaking about complex ideas and may use limited vocabulary. At times, he will interject an off-topic question or comment during a conversation with someone. This is consistent with his attention and executive functioning needs. There are no relevant concerns at this time.
