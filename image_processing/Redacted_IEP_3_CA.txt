``` ```
### SECTION PRESENT LEVELS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Student currently has a 60% (Standard Not Met) in Science. Student earned scores of 80%, 73%, and 55% on the three mini summative assessments and also a 55% on the one major summative assessment. Student has shown mastery of standards related to producing clear/coherent writing, describing through models the arrangement of objects interacting, applying Newton’s Third Law, constructing and presenting arguments using evidence to support the claim, and asking questions about data. She has not shown mastery of standards related to defining the criteria/constraints of a design problem, planning an investigation to provide evidence to a claim, constructing a scientific explanation based on evidence, nor constructing/interpreting graphical displays of data to describe the relationships of kinetic energy to the mass / speed of an object. Teacher reports that she is very persistent and very focused. An area for growth is to continue to push herself to keep improving in class. 

Electives: Student currently has a 95% in RE and a 100% in Art.

### SECTION COMMUNICATION DEVELOPMENT
This is an annual review for Student Last Name. Student is a 9th grader at School San Jose Collegiate. She receives direct intervention under the eligibility of Speech-Language Impairment (SLI). Due to distance learning related to COVID-19, speech therapy services are provided virtually. During the period of distance learning from 8/27/2020 to present, Student has demonstrated challenges with attendance and engagement in speech therapy. The following attempts were made to support Student's attendance and progress toward her goal: calls and/or text messages, recurring calendar invites, emails, whole-group and individual prompts to turn on the camera, and whole-group prompts to chat or come off of mute to participate. Since Student's last IEP, she has been working on identifying and producing complex sentences. In order to show mastery, Student has to demonstrate the ability to use at least 15 subordinating conjunctions when generating complex sentences, either verbally or in writing. The clinician collected the following information related to Student's progress toward this goal: After reviewing lessons on complex sentences, Student is able to independently identify independent and dependent clauses in complex sentences with 90% accuracy. When asked to combine simple sentences to produce complex sentences, she is able to choose the correct answer in a multiple-choice format with 70% accuracy and no assistance. When asked to combine two simple sentences using a specific subordinating conjunction, Student is able to achieve this with 50% accuracy and no assistance. Currently, Student is able to use, at most, 5 subordinating conjunctions to produce complex sentences with minimal cues/prompts. Given distance learning and Student's frequent absences in speech therapy sessions, it has been a challenge for the clinician to gauge Student's progress in meeting this goal for the following reasons: Student had fewer opportunities to learn more about other subordinating conjunctions, to practice generating complex sentences, and to receive feedback and show growth. Student would continue to benefit from receiving speech and language therapy to improve her communication skills and access her general education curriculum.

### SECTION GROSS/FINE MOTOR DEVELOPMENT
Student's gross/fine motor development is age-appropriate. There are no concerns at this time.

### SECTION SOCIAL EMOTIONAL/BEHAVIORAL
Student has age-appropriate interactions with peers and adults. She is capable of following directions and demonstrates on-task behavior in the classroom. In the virtual classroom space, however, Student is less communicative and participatory. Her work completion and classroom engagement have both been impacted. Beyond this specific situation, there are no concerns at this time.

### SECTION VOCATIONAL
There are no concerns at this time.

### SECTION ADAPTIVE/DAILY LIVING SKILLS
Student comes to school dressed neatly and is able to take care of all her daily needs independently. There are no concerns at this time.
``` ```
### SECTION CONSERVATORSHIP

She showed a relative strength in the area of Vocabulary: Acquisition and Use and a relative weakness in the area of Informational Text: Key Ideas and Details. Student currently has a 88% (Standard Met) in ELA. Student earned an 88% and 87% on her 2 mini summative assessments and a 90% on her only Major Summative Assessment grade. According to assessment data, Student has shown mastery of standards related to writing including analyzing how particular elements of a story or drama interact, and citing several pieces of textual evidence to support an analysis.

An area for growth would be for her to raise her hand more in class to contribute to class discussions and to ask for help. 

Math: 
Student took the NWEA MAP for math in Fall 2019. She received a RIT score of 214, which places her in the 25th percentile for 8th-grade students.

### SECTION OFFER OF FAPE - SERVICE
The service options that were considered by the IEP team (List all): During the period of school closure related to COVID-19, the IEP team considered virtual learning without supplementary aids & services, virtual learning with supplementary aids & services, and continued in-person supplementary aids & services during the period of school closure. When the temporary period of school closure ends, students will return to previous placement: The IEP team considered General Education, Specialized Academic Instruction, and Speech and Language Services. In selecting LRE, describe the consideration given to any potential harmful effect on the child or on the quality of services that he or she needs: The IEP team considered the harmful effects of the proposed placement, virtual learning with supplementary aids & services, including limited access to general education content, limited access to special education services, and possible regression and lack of recoupment associated with a prolonged period of distance learning. The IEP team also discussed the harmful effects of in-person service provision, including the possible legal ramifications of violating the Bay Area’s Shelter In Place Order, in addition to the risk to public health and health of the student. The IEP team believes that the possible harmful effects of the placement of virtual learning with supplemental aids & services are outweighed by the necessity to protect public health and the health of the student. The IEP team will consider the appropriateness and/or necessity of compensatory services and/or extended school year upon return to typical school operations. Previous: When considering potential harmful effects, the team considered potential stigmatization, separation from the general education curriculum, and decreased interaction with general education peers. The team has decided the benefits outweigh the potential harmful effects and the student's disability requires services provided.
