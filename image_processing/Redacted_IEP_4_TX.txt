### SECTION PRESENT LEVELS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM (IEP)  
[X] Yes  
[ ] No  
[ ] OO NA The ARD committee reviewed achievement of the previous year's goals on the IEP. (Applicable to all but initial ARD meetings.)  

Reading: 
Student is a 7th grade student at Sample Middle School. Student qualifies for special education services due to a specific learning disability in basic reading. Adyson's specific learning disability affects her ability to understand and/or use spoken or written language, resulting in achievement that is not commensurate with her age or ability in the area of basic reading. This impacts access to reading-related instruction and tasks such as reading a grade level text, answering comprehension questions and identifying key details and/or main idea of a text. On four significant assignments, this previous six weeks - on which the main idea and supporting facts were measured, Student scored an 86, 95, 90 and 86. This is evidence that she has mastered her goal of 80% accuracy from last year. Feedback from Adyson's other core teachers, both stated that she often needs to be reminded to stay on task and even with the use of the extra time accommodation, she needs to be aware of time constraints. Another accommodation that should aid Student on tests is small group testing for all core subjects. Ms. Hayes noted that Student does work hard on assignments, is self-advocatory and works well in a peer-partnered setting. Upon reviewing Adyson's previous year's scores from ELA base-line screeners, it is evident that she has made incredible progress. She has grown a full three years of grade level achievement. Last year, Student scored between a 230 and 400 (2nd grade 3rd month - beginning 4th grade) to 510 and 700 (5th grade 1st month - beginning 7th grade) in overall ELA achievement. Her overall Reading level last year indicated she was at 270 - 450 (2nd grade 7th month - 4th grade 5th month) and this year she is at 590 - 780 (5th grade 9th month - 7th grade 8th month). Upon analyzing Adyson's Interim Assessments from last year to this year, her strengths are the understanding of figurative language and the ability to paraphrase passages and she struggles with inferencing and determination of author's purpose in factual text analysis.  

Math: 
Student is a 7th grade student that qualifies with a Specific Learning Disability in the areas of listening comprehension, basic reading skills, and math problem solving. Based on her FIE data 6/14/2022, she also demonstrates deficits in the areas of long-term retrieval, auditory processing, and visual processing. Her deficit in visual processing impacts her ability to perceive, analyze, synthesize, manipulate, and think with visual patterns and stimuli. Her deficit in long-term retrieval impacts her ability to store new information and fluently retrieve stored information through association. Her deficit in auditory processing impacts her ability to notice, compare, discriminate.

and distinguish sounds. It reflects phonetic coding skills (e.g., blending, deletion, phoneme manipulation). Last year Student made progress on her goal of writing and solving algebraic equations with 75% accuracy by 70% mastery as measured by data collection, daily work, and assessments. This year the data collection, daily work, assessments, IXL Diagnostic Screener, and STAAR data show that Student has demonstrated strengths in numbers and operations, as well as algebra and algebraic thinking. She has demonstrated weaknesses in measurement and fractions. Her previous goal will be discontinued and a new goal will be written to address her current needs. Mrs. Spencer and Ms. Holler report that Student has been doing well in Math in 7th grade. She receives between 70-90 on assessments, having to correct only 2/5 assessments thus far. The majority of her daily work have been A's and B's, with only failing grade for the year. She earned a 91 for the 1st 6-weeks, a 90 for the 2nd 6-weeks, and an 88 for the 3rd 6-weeks. She finished the 1st semester with a 90 average. She works hard and takes advantage of her accommodations when needed. Adyson's baseline data for Math is an early 5th grade to early 6th grade level overall. This was measured by the IXL Math Diagnostic Screener. Grade level peers perform at a 4th to 6th grade level on the same math screener. Based on her 6th grade STAAR test, her quantile level is 600. Her STAAR and IXL data are as follows: STAAR - 1490 (raw - 11/29%) which demonstrates that she did not meet grade level, although she was only 3 correct answers away from approaching grade level. Numerical Representations & Relationships - 4/10 Computations & Algebraic Relationships - 4/15 Geometry & Measurement - 0/6 Data Analysis & Personal Financial Literacy - 3/7 IXL - Overall math level - 520-620 (early 5th - early 6th) Numbers & Operations - 730 (early 7th grade) Algebra & Algebraic Thinking - 710-780 (early 7th - end of 7th) Fractions - 270-410 (end of 2nd - early 4th) Geometry - 570-640 (end of 5th - mid 6th) Measurement - 30-180 (early kinder - end of 1st) Data Analysis, Statistics, & Probability - 570-770 (end of 5th to end of 7th);

### SECTION ASSURANCES
ASSURANCES: parents assured by: Name: Heather Henson Title: ARD Facilitator The ARD committee assures that removal of students with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. The ARD committee assures that each student with a disability participates in nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities, including meals, and recess periods, with nondisabled students to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the student. The ARD committee assures that to the maximum extent appropriate, students with disabilities, including students in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with students who are nondisabled. 

### SECTION ACCESS TO AND DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS
Access to and Destruction of Records The special education department observes federal and state laws, state regulations and local policies pertaining to the confidentiality of student records. Parents (or an eligible student 18 years or older) may inspect and review records at any time. School officials with a legitimate educational interest have access to student records. The parents of a student with a disability must give written consent before a student's records can be seen by someone not involved in the student's education. If the student transfers to another school district, special education records will be sent to the receiving district without parental consent. Special education eligibility and educational records are maintained for seven (7) years following the date of the last recorded action for each student served by the Special Education Department of Sample Independent School District. At the end of seven years, the records may be destroyed. Parent/guardian/adult student has been informed that the District shall retain education records of students with disabilities for seven years after the student's graduation or dismissal from special education.
